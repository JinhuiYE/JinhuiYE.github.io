I am a committed researcher and AI enthusiast. I received my degree in [Software Engineering from South China University of Technology](http://www2.scut.edu.cn/sse/){: .no-underline } in 2022. Currently, I'm pursuing a Master of Philosophy in the Thrust of Artificial Intelligence at The [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)](https://hkust-gz.edu.cn/academics/four-hubs/information-hub/artificial-intelligence){: .no-underline } supervised By [Prof. Hui Xiong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cVDF1tkAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao){: .no-underline } and [Junwei Liang](https://junweiliang.me/index.html){: .no-underline }.

My research interests lie in the intersection of gesture-based understanding, perception and human-machine collaboration based on language. Previously, I interned at [Tencent AI Lab](https://ai.tencent.com/ailab/nlp/en/index.html){: .no-underline }, working on sign language translation in collaboration with [Xing Wang](http://xingwang4nlp.com/){: .no-underline } and [Wenxiang Jiao](https://wxjiao.github.io/){: .no-underline }. Currently, I'm part of the Multimodal Human-Computer Interaction Group at HKUST-GZ, focusing on multimodal human-computer interaction and collaboration, in partnership with PhD candidate [Weiyu Guo](https://guoweiyu.github.io/){: .no-underline }.

Moving forward, I aim to make a significant impact by applying Language Model Learning (LLM) in various domains (LLM for X), expanding the boundaries of AI applications.
