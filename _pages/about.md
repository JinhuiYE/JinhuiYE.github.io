I received my degree in Software Engineering from South China University of Technology (2018/09 - 2022/07). Currently, I'm pursuing a Master of Philosophy focusing on AI at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) under the supervision of [Prof. Hui Xiong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cVDF1tkAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao) (2022/09 - present). 

my research is centered around gesture-based understanding and human-computer interaction. Previously, I interned at [Tencent AI Lab](https://ai.tencent.com/ailab/nlp/en/index.html), working on sign language translation research under the mentorship of [Xing Wang](http://xingwang4nlp.com/) and [Wenxiang Jiao](https://wxjiao.github.io/). Now, I'm part of the Multimodal Human-Computer Interaction Group at my university, focusing on multimodal human-computer interaction and collaboration, in cooperation with PhD candidate [Guo Weiyu](https://guoweiyu.github.io/).
